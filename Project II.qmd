## Introduction

The Common Cuckoo (*Cuculus canorus*) is a bird species known for its distinctive behaviours and characteristics, particularly its unusual reproductive strategy. As brood parasites, cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other, often smaller, bird species. The host bird then incubates the cuckoo egg and unknowingly raises the chick as its own (Davies, 2011; Lahti, 2005). According to Kruger and Davies (2003), Davies (2011), and Lahti (2005), the survival of the cuckoo species hinges on their remarkable adaptation strategies, which include evading host defences through deception and matching their egg and chick development with the host's incubation and provisioning patterns.

Research conducted in Russia has provided evidence of evolutionary adaptation in cuckoos, particularly in their ability to vary egg size to match that of their hosts. This adaptation reduces the likelihood of egg rejection, as host birds are more inclined to reject eggs that are significantly different or larger than their own clutch (Meshcheryagina et al., 2018). The study found that while the breadth of cuckoo eggs closely matched that of the host species, the length did not, suggesting a trade-off that limits the cuckoo's ability to maintain larger egg volumes. This alignment in egg breadth is likely an evolved response to avoid host rejection (Meshcheryagina *et al*., 2018).

This project aims to investigate the egg dimensions—length and breadth—of six different cuckoo bird species, analysing 120 eggs. Various statistical analyses will be performed to determine differences in these dimensions both between and within the species.

## Importing Data

For data manipulation, visualisation and analysis and to effectively read and access the relevant cuckoo data, the "tidyverse" was installed and activated. The read.csv () function was used to import and read the data that is in CSV format. The data was assigned a new name termed cuckoo_data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

cuckoo_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/bootcamp-test/master/data/cuckoo.csv")

```

To view and understand the contents of the data names() function was used to return the names of the columns in the cuckoo_data, this also ensures that the data has been imported correctly. The names of the the cuckoo_data are "length" "breadth" "species"

```{r}
names(cuckoo_data)
```

The names of the variables in the data is given above. The head() function was implemented to preview the first 10 rows of the data, while the tail() function was run to preview the last 10 rows of the dataset, thus making it easier to observe patterns in the data.

A preview of the data is presented in @tbl-data-preview.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-data-preview
#| tbl-cap: "Data Preview"
#| tbl-subcap: true

head(cuckoo_data, n = 10)
tail(cuckoo_data, n = 10)
```

To further understand and observe the cuckoo_data the car::some() function was run, first setting a seed, to randomly select and generate a sample of rows from the cuckoo_data dataset. The set. seed() allows the same results every time the code is run.

```{r}
set.seed(3891)
car::some(cuckoo_data)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Various analyses were conducted to investigate the main characteristics and understand the structure of the dataset. The summary() function gave statistics of the three variables in the data frame; length, breadth, and species below:

A quick descriptive statistics of the data is given below:

```{r}
summary(cuckoo_data)
```

The str() function was run to show the data structure and the type and length of variables in the dataset. For cuckoo_data the str() function showed that the data has 120 observations and 3 variables, and the variable's length and breadth are numerical, while the species variable is a character, as seen below:

```{r}
str(cuckoo_data)
```

To identify distinct species present in the data frame, the unique() function was used and it generated six species names in the data: Meadow Pipit, Tree Pipit, Hedge Sparrow, Robin, Pied Wagtail and Wren.

```{r}
unique(cuckoo_data$species)
```

The skim() function was run to obtain an extended structure of the data and gave statistical values of the data such as mean, median, and standard deviation along with missing values and histograms of the data.

```{r}
skimr::skim(cuckoo_data)
```

## Data Visualisation

The box plot provides a visual summary of key statistics for the breadth of eggs within each species

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cuckoo_data, aes(species, breadth)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Breadth (mm)", 
       title = "Breadth size between Species")
```

The box plot provides a visual summary of key statistics for the length of eggs within each species

```{r}
ggplot(cuckoo_data, aes(species, length)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Length (mm)", 
       title = "Length size bewteen Species")
```

Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between breadth and length measurements within cuckoo bird species.

```{r}
ggplot(cuckoo_data, aes(x = length, y = breadth, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Egg Length (mm)",
       y = "Egg Breadth (mm)", 
       title = "Breath and Length Measurements Across Species")
```

The distribution of length measurements by species is shown below using a density plot.

```{r}
ggplot(cuckoo_data, aes(x = length, fill = species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Egg Length (mm)", y = "Density",
       title = "Density Plot of Egg Length by Species")
```

The distribution of breadth measurements by species is shown below.

```{r}
ggplot(cuckoo_data, aes(x = breadth, fill = species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Egg Breadth (mm)", y = "Density",
       title = "Density Plot of Egg Breadth by Species")
```

## Inferential Statistical Analysis

The results ANOVA test were conducted to observe if there is a statically significant difference in the breadth of eggs between species is below:

```{r}
breadth_anova <- aov(breadth ~ species, data = cuckoo_data) |>
  anova()
breadth_anova
```

The ANOVA results to see if there is a statically significant difference between the length of the eggs and species has a P-value of

```{r}
length_anova <- aov(length ~ species, data = cuckoo_data)|>
  anova()

length_anova
```

Linear regression model accessing a relationship between lengths and breadths of eggs shows a positive relationship.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
lm_model <- lm(breadth ~ length + species, data = cuckoo_data) |>
  summary()

ggplot(cuckoo_data, aes(x = length, y = breadth)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Length", y = "Breadth") +
  ggtitle("Relationship between Egg Breadth and Length") +
  theme_gray()

```

## Discussion and Conclusion

The ANOVA test assessing the influence of species on the breadth of cuckoo eggs reveals a statistically significant difference in egg breadth among the different cuckoo species. This is proved by the small p-value (1.412e-08), the highly significant code (\*\*\*), and a high F value (10.885), which indicate that the variation between species is greater than the variation within species. Therefore, species have a significant effect on the breadth of eggs.

Similarly, the ANOVA test evaluating the influence of species on the length of cuckoo eggs also shows a statistically significant difference in egg length across species. The p-value of 2.852e-08 and the associated significance code (\*\*\*) provide strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that species significantly affect egg length.

Additionally, the linear regression model demonstrates a positive relationship between the breadth and length of the eggs, suggesting that an increase in breadth is associated with an increase in length, and vice versa.
